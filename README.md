## FAQ

### I don't want motion blur.
* Turn off Reblur and save the preset.

### I'm getting weird white flicker when in darker areas, how can i fix it ?
* You can't, wait for an update to RTGI or turn up the specular lighting quality.

### I don't have one of the shaders you're using?
* Every free shader i used is in the zip you download. if it's not in there it's a 5$ [paid shader by Marty](https://www.martysmods.com/)

### I have this or that issue with reshade
* Refer to this [GitHub made by ipsu](https://github.com/ipsusu/ipsuShade?tab=readme-ov-file#troubleshooting-and-common-issues-updated-for-dawntrail-graphics-update) for any issues not directly related to my presets or join marty's discord for RTGI specific problems.

### Do you have screenshot or gpose presets?
* No and i probably never will, i only wanted a simple preset for general gameplay
